  The Void Library — an ancient archive containing forbidden knowledge, 
  accessible only through a decrepit search terminal.
  
  The librarians were sloppy with their code. The search function seems 
  to do more than just echo your query...
  
  **Connection:** `nc ctf.neocyberrange.com 9004`
  
  **Hints:**
  - What happens when user input meets shell commands?
  - Special characters can break things... or break INTO things
  - `; && || $()` — the classics never die
