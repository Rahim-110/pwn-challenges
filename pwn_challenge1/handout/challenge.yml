  **Year 2042.** Gotham's legendary Batcomputer has been decommissioned... or so they thought.
  
  A rogue signal from the old Wayne Manor servers has been detected. The system is still running, 
  but it's locked behind military-grade security verification.
  
  Your mission: Bypass the authentication and access the classified intel.
  
  **Connection:** `nc ctf.neocyberrange.com 9001`
  
  **Hints:**
  - The logging system seems to print your input in a strange way...
  - `%x %x %x` might reveal more than expected
  - Format strings can read AND write memory
