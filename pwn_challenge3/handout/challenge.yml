  **Orbital Position: LEO-7**
  
  Space Station Alpha's access terminal is still operational after the evacuation.
  The authentication system was hastily deployed, and rumor has it there's a 
  maintenance override hidden somewhere in the binary.
  
  Bypass the security and spawn a shell to retrieve the classified data.
  
  **Connection:** `nc ctf.neocyberrange.com 9003`
  
  **Hints:**
  - How big is the access code buffer?
  - The unlock function is waiting to be called...
  - Stack alignment matters on x86-64
