  **Deep Space, Sector 7-G.**
  
  The NEXUS-7 research station went dark 47 years ago. No survivors. No explanation.
  
  You're a salvage operator who just docked at the abandoned station. The emergency console 
  is still functional, but the AI seems... corrupted. There's an override function somewhere 
  in the system — if only you could reach it.
  
  **Connection:** `nc ctf.neocyberrange.com 9002`
  
  **Hints:**
  - The distress signal transmitter accepts user input
  - Old C functions have dangerous habits
  - Return addresses live on the stack
